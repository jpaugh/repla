Repl Any
========
Use `repla` to convert any command into a shell. There are lots of
commands that have awesome subcommands, but lack a proper shell. `repla`
saves the day! Also, there are many other commands that you may wish to
call repeatedly from your shell. `repla` saves you typing!

`repla` was born of my annoyance with retyping `git cmd` all of the
time. So the focus of it's development is to make `git` (or any command)
less annoying. And it does.
